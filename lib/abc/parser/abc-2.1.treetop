  # 2.1 Abc file identification
  # All abc files should have the extension ".abc" (all lower-case) on all platforms.
  # Comment: Some web-servers only allow a limited selection of file types; in this case a ".txt" extension is the best alternative.
  # Every abc file should begin with the string %abc. An optional version number may follow on the same line, e.g.
  #   %abc-2.1
  # Version numbers of 2.1 or higher indicate that the abc file is to be interpreted strictly according to the corresponding abc standard; if the version number is missing, the file will be treated under loose interpretation. The version field may also be used to indicate abc versions for individual tunes.
  
  ## TODO deal with this in preprocessor?


  # 2.2 Abc file structure
  # An abc file consists of one or more abc tune transcriptions, optionally interspersed with free text and typeset text annotations. It may optionally start with a file header to set up default values for processing the file.
  # The file header, abc tunes and text annotations are separated from each other by empty lines (also known as blank lines).
  # An abc file with more than one tune in it is called an abc tunebook.

  # The tune body, which contains the music code, follows immediately after. Certain fields may also be used inside the tune body - see use of fields within the tune body.
  # It is legal to write an abc tune without a tune body. This feature can be used to document tunes without transcribing them.
  # Abc music code lines are those lines in the tune body which give notes, bar lines and other musical symbols - see the tune body for details. In effect, music code is the contents of any line which is not an information field, stylesheet directive or comment line.

  # The file header may only appear at the beginning of a file, not between tunes.
  # Settings in a tune may override the file header settings, but when the end of a tune is reached the defaults set by the file header are reinstated.
  # Applications which extract separate tunes from a file must insert the fields of the original file header into the header of the extracted tune. However, since users may manually extract tunes without regard to the file header, it is not recommended to use a file header in an abc tunebook that is to be distributed.

  # 2.2.3 Free text and typeset text
  # The terms free text and typeset text refer to any text not directly included within the information fields in a tune header. Typically such text is used for annotating abc tunebooks; free text is for annotating the abc file but is not included in the typeset score, whereas typeset text is intended for printing out.
  # Free text is just that. It can be included anywhere in an abc file, after the file header, but must be separated from abc tunes, typeset text and the file header by empty lines. Typically it is used for annotating the abc file but in principle can be any text not containing information fields.
  # Comment: Since raw html markup and email headers are treated as free text (provided they don't inadvertently contain information fields) this means that abc software can process a wide variety of text-based input files just by ignoring non-abc code.
  # By default free text is not included in the printed score, although typesetting software may offer the option to print it out (e.g. via a command line switch or GUI checkbox). In this case, the software should treat the free text as a text string, but may format it in any way it chooses.
  # Typeset text is any text specified using text directives. It may be inserted anywhere in an abc file after the file header, either separated from tunes by empty lines, or included in the tune header or tune body.
  # Typeset text should be printed by typesetting programs although its exact position in the printed score is program-dependent.
  # Typeset text that is included in an abc tune (i.e. within the tune header or tune body), must be retained by any programs, such as databasing software, that splits an abc file into separate abc tunes.

  # 2.2.4 Empty lines and line-breaking
  # Empty lines (also known as blank lines) are used to separate abc tunes, free text and the file header. They also aid the readability of abc files.
  # Lines that consist entirely of white-space (space and tab characters) are also regarded as empty lines.
  # Line-breaks (also known as new lines, line feeds, carriage returns, end-of-lines, etc.) can be used within an abc file to aid readability and, if required, break up long input lines - see continuation of input lines.
  # More specifically, line-breaks in the music code can be used to structure the abc transcription and, by default, generate line-breaks in the printed music. For more details see typesetting line-breaks.

  # 2.2.5 Comments and remarks
  # A percent symbol (%) will cause the remainder of any input line to be ignored. It can be used to add a comment to the end of an abc line or as a comment line in its own right. (To get a percent symbol, type \% - see text strings.)
  # Alternatively, you can use the syntax [r:remark] to write a remark in the middle of a line of music.
  # Example:
  #   |:DEF FED| % this is an end of line comment
  #   % this is a comment line
  #   DEF [r:and this is a remark] FED:|
  # Abc code which contains comments and remarks should be processed in exactly the same way as it would be if all the comments and remarks were removed (although, if the code is preprocessed, and comments are actually removed, the stylesheet directives should be left in place).
  # Important clarification: lines which just contain a comment are processed as if the entire line were removed, even if the comment is preceded by white-space (i.e. the % symbol is the not first character). In other words, removing the comment effectively removes the entire line and so no empty line is introduced.

  # 2.2.6 Continuation of input lines
  # It is sometimes necessary to tell abc software that an input line is continued on the next physical line(s) in the abc file, so that the two (or more) lines are treated as one. In abc 2.0 there was a universal continuation character (see outdated continuations) for this purpose, but it was decided that this was both unnecessary and confusing.
  # In abc 2.1, there are ways of continuing each of the 4 different input line types: music code, information fields, comments and stylesheet directives.
  # In abc music code, by default, line-breaks in the code generate line-breaks in the typeset score and these can be suppressed by using a backslash (or by telling abc typesetting software to ignore line-breaks using I:linebreak $ or I:linebreak <none>) - see typesetting line-breaks for full details.
  # Comment for programmers: The backslash effectively acts as a continuation character for music code lines, although, for those used to encountering it in other computer language contexts, its use is very abc-specific. In particular it can continue music code lines through information fields, comments and stylesheet directives.
  # The 3 other input line types can be continued as follows:
  #   information fields can be continued using +: at the start of the following line - see field continuation;
  #   comments can easily be continued by adding a % symbol at the start of the following line - since they are ignored by abc software it doesn't matter how many lines they are split into;
  #   most stylesheet directives are too short to require a continuation syntax, but if one is required then use the I:<directive> form (see I:instruction), in place of %%<directive> and continue the line as a field - see field continuation.
  # Comment for developers: Unlike other languages, and because of the way in which both information fields and music code can be continued through comments, stylesheet directives and (in the case of music code) information fields, it is generally not possible to parse abc files by pre-processing continuations into single lines.
  # Note that, with the exception of abc music code, continuations are unlikely to be needed often. Indeed in most cases it should be possible, although not necessarily desirable, to write very long input lines, since most abc editing software will display them as wrapped within the text editor window.
  # Recommendation: Despite there being no limit on line length in abc files, it is recommended that users avoid writing abc code with very long lines. In particular, judiciously applied line-breaks can aid the (human) readability of abc code. More importantly, users who send abc tunes with long lines should be aware that email software sometimes introduces additional line-breaks into lines with more than 72 characters and these may even cause errors when the resulting tune is processed.

  # 2.3.1 Embedded abc fragment
  # An abc fragment is a partial abc tune. It may contain a partial tune header with no body or a tune body with optional tune header information fields.

  # <div class="abc-fragment">
  # CDEF GABc|
  # </div>
  # Example 2: A fragment with a partial tune header:
  # <div class="abc-fragment">
  # T:Major scale in D
  # K:D
  # DEFG ABcd|
  # </div>
  # Unless T:, M: and K: fields are present, a fragment is assumed to describe a stave in the treble clef with no title, no meter indication and no key signature, respectively.
  # An abc fragment does not require an empty line to mark the end of the tune body if it is terminated by the document markup.
  # Note for developers: For processing as an abc tune, the parsing code is notionally assumed to add empty X:, T: and K: fields, if these are missing. However, since the processing generally takes place internally within a software package, these need not be added in actuality.

  # 3. Information fields
  # Any line beginning with a letter in the range A-Z or a-z and immediately followed by a colon (:) is an information field. Information fields are used to notate things such as composer, meter, etc. In fact anything that isn't music.
  # An information field may also be inlined in a tune body when enclosed by [ and ] - see use of fields within the tune body.
  # Many of these information field identifiers are currently unused so, in order to extend the number of information fields in the future, programs that comply with this standard must ignore the occurrence of information fields not defined here (although they should give a non-fatal error message to warn the user, in case the field identifier is an error or is unsupported).
  # Some information fields are permitted only in the file or tune header and some only in the tune body, while others are allowed in both locations. information field identifiers A-G, X-Z and a-g, x-z are not permitted in the body to avoid confusion with note symbols, rests and spacers.
  # Users who wish to use abc notation solely for transcribing (rather than documenting) tunes can ignore most of the information fields. For this purpose all that is really needed are the X:(reference number), T:(title), M:(meter), L:(unit note length) and K:(key) information fields, plus if applicable C:(composer) and w: or W: (words/lyrics, respectively within or after the tune).
  # Recommendation for newcomers: A good way to find out how to use the fields is to look at the example files, sample abc tunes (in particular English.abc), and try out some examples.
  # The information fields are summarised in the following table and discussed in description of information fields and elsewhere.
  # The table illustrates how the information fields may be used in the tune header and whether they may also be used in the tune body (see use of fields within the tune body for details) or in the file header (see abc file structure).
  
  # Repeated information fields
  # All information fields, with the exception of X:, may appear more than once in an abc tune.
  # In the case of all string-type information fields, repeated use in the tune header can be regarded as additional information - for example, a tune may be known by many titles and an abc tune transcription may appear at more than one URL (using the F: field). Typesetting software which prints this information out may concatenate all string-type information fields of the same kind, separated by semi-colons (;), although the initial T:(title) field should be treated differently, as should W:(words) fields - see typesetting information fields.
  # Certain instruction-type information fields, in particular I:, m:, U: and V:, may also be used multiple times in the tune header to set up different instructions, macros, user definitions and voices. However, if two such fields set up the same value, then the second overrides the first.
  # Example: The second I:linebreak instruction overrides the first.
  # I:linebreak <EOL>
  # I:linebreak <none>
  # Comment: The above example should not generate an error message. The user may legitimately wish to test the effect of two such instructions; having them both makes switching from one to another easy just by changing their order.
  # Other instruction-type information fields in the tune header also override the previous occurrence of that field.
  # Within the tune body each line of code is processed in sequence. Therefore, with the exception of s:(symbol line), w:(words) and W:(words) which have their own syntax, the same information field may occur a number of times, for example to change key, meter, tempo or voice, and each occurrence has the effect of overriding the previous one, either for the remainder of the tune, or until the next occurrence. See use of fields within the tune body for more details.

  # 3.1.7 L: - unit note length

  # Commonly used values for unit note length are L:1/4 - quarter note (crotchet), L:1/8 - eighth note (quaver) and L:1/16 - sixteenth note (semi-quaver). L:1 (whole note) - or equivalently L:1/1, L:1/2 (minim), L:1/32 (demi-semi-quaver), L:1/64, L:1/128, L:1/256 and L:1/512 are also available, although L:1/64 and shorter values are optional and may not be provided by all software packages.
  # If there is no L: field defined, a unit note length is set by default, based on the meter field M:. This default is calculated by computing the meter as a decimal: if it is less than 0.75 the default unit note length is a sixteenth note; if it is 0.75 or greater, it is an eighth note. For example, 2/4 = 0.5, so, the default unit note length is a sixteenth note, while for 4/4 = 1.0, or 6/8 = 0.75, or 3/4= 0.75, it is an eighth note. For M:C (4/4), M:C| (2/2) and M:none (free meter), the default unit note length is 1/8.

  # 3.1.9 P: - parts
  # VOLATILE: For music with more than one voice, interaction between the P: and V: fields will be clarified when multi-voice music is addressed in abc 2.2. The use of P: for single voice music will be revisited at the same time.
  # The P: field can be used in the tune header to state the order in which the tune parts are played, i.e. P:ABABCDCD, and then inside the tune body to mark each part, i.e. P:A or P:B. (In this context part refers to a section of the tune, rather than a voice in multi-voice music.)
  # Within the tune header, you can give instruction to repeat a part by following it with a number: e.g. P:A3 is equivalent to P:AAA. You can make a sequence repeat by using parentheses: e.g. P:(AB)3 is equivalent to P:ABABAB. Nested parentheses are permitted; dots may be placed anywhere within the header P: field to increase legibility: e.g. P:((AB)3.(CD)3)2. These dots are ignored by computer programs.
  # See variant endings and lyrics for possible uses of P: notation.
  # Player programs should use the P: field if possible to render a complete playback of the tune; typesetting programs should include the P: field values in the printed score.
# See typesetting information fields for details of how the part information may be included in the printed score.

  # 3.1.10 Z: - transcription
  # Typically the Z: field contains the name(s) of the person(s) who transcribed the tune into abc, and possibly some contact information, e.g. an (e-)mail address or homepage URL.
  # Example: Simple transcription notes.
  # Z:John Smith, <j.s@mail.com>
  # However, it has also taken over the role of the %%abc-copyright and %%abc-edited-by since they have been deprecated (see outdated directives).
  # Example: Detailed transcription notes.
  # Z:abc-transcription John Smith, <j.s@mail.com>, 1st Jan 2010
  # Z:abc-edited-by Fred Bloggs, <f.b@mail.com>, 31st Dec 2010
  # Z:abc-copyright &copy; John Smith
  # This new usage means that an update history can be recorded in collections which are collaboratively edited by a number of users.
  # Note that there is no formal syntax for the contents of this field, although users are strongly encouraged to be consistent, but, by convention, Z:abc-copyright refers to the copyright of the abc transcription rather than the tune.
  # See typesetting information fields for details of how the transcription information may be included in the printed score.
  # Comment: If required, software may even choose to interpret specific Z: strings, for example to print out the string which follows after Z:abc-copyright.

  # 3.1.11 N: - notes
  # Contains general annotations, such as references to other tunes which are similar, details on how the original notation of the tune was converted to abc, etc.
  # See typesetting information fields for details of how notes may be included in the printed score.

  # 3.1.12 G: - group
  # Database software may use this field to group together tunes (for example by instruments) for indexing purposes. It can also be used for creating medleys - however, this usage is not standardised.

  # 3.1.13 H: - history
  # Designed for multi-line notes, stories and anecdotes.
  # Although the H: fields are typically not typeset, the correct usage for multi-line input is to use field continuation syntax (+:), rather than H: at the start of each subsequent line of a multi-line note. This allows, for example, database applications to distinguish between two different anecdotes.
  # Examples:
  # H:this is considered
  # +:as a single entry
  # H:this usage is considered as two entries
  # H:rather than one
  # The original usage of H: (where subsequent lines need no field indicator) is now deprecated (see outdated information field syntax).
  # See typesetting information fields for details of how the history may be included in the printed score.

  # ^^ all covered under string fields


  # 3.1.14 K: - key
  # The key signature should be specified with a capital letter (A-G) which may be followed by a # or b for sharp or flat respectively. In addition the mode should be specified (when no mode is indicated, major is assumed).
  # For example, K:C major, K:A minor, K:C ionian, K:A aeolian, K:G mixolydian, K:D dorian, K:E phrygian, K:F lydian and K:B locrian would all produce a staff with no sharps or flats. The spaces can be left out, capitalisation is ignored for the modes and in fact only the first three letters of each mode are parsed so that, for example, K:F# mixolydian is the same as K:F#Mix or even K:F#MIX. As a special case, minor may be abbreviated to m.
  # This table sums up how the same key signatures can be written in different ways:

  # Mode	 Ionian	 Aeolian	 Mixolydian	 Dorian	 Phrygian	 Lydian	 Locrian
  # Key Signature	 Major	 Minor					
  # 7 sharps	C#	A#m	G#Mix	D#Dor	E#Phr	F#Lyd	B#Loc
  # 6 sharps	F#	D#m	C#Mix	G#Dor	A#Phr	BLyd	E#Loc
  # 5 sharps	B	G#m	F#Mix	C#Dor	D#Phr	ELyd	A#Loc
  # 4 sharps	E	C#m	BMix	F#Dor	G#Phr	ALyd	D#Loc
  # 3 sharps	A	F#m	EMix	BDor	C#Phr	DLyd	G#Loc
  # 2 sharps	D	Bm	AMix	EDor	F#Phr	GLyd	C#Loc
  # 1 sharp	G	Em	DMix	ADor	BPhr	CLyd	F#Loc
  # 0 sharps/flats	C	Am	GMix	DDor	EPhr	FLyd	BLoc
  # 1 flat	F	Dm	CMix	GDor	APhr	BbLyd	ELoc
  # 2 flats	Bb	Gm	FMix	CDor	DPhr	EbLyd	ALoc
  # 3 flats	Eb	Cm	BbMix	FDor	GPhr	AbLyd	DLoc
  # 4 flats	Ab	Fm	EbMix	BbDor	CPhr	DbLyd	GLoc
  # 5 flats	Db	Bbm	AbMix	EbDor	FPhr	GbLyd	CLoc
  # 6 flats	Gb	Ebm	DbMix	AbDor	BbPhr	CbLyd	FLoc
  # 7 flats	Cb	Abm	GbMix	DbDor	EbPhr	FbLyd	BbLoc

  # By specifying an empty K: field, or K:none, it is possible to use no key signature at all.
  # The key signatures may be modified by adding accidentals, according to the format K:<tonic> <mode> <accidentals>. For example, K:D Phr ^f would give a key signature with two flats and one sharp, which designates a very common mode in Klezmer (Ahavoh Rabboh) and in Arabic music (Maqam Hedjaz). Likewise, "K:D maj =c" or "K:D =c" will give a key signature with F sharp and c natural (the D mixolydian mode). Note that there can be several modifying accidentals, separated by spaces, each beginning with an accidental sign (__, _, =, ^ or ^^), followed by a note letter. The case of the letter is used to determine on which line the accidental is placed.
  # It is possible to use the format K:<tonic> exp <accidentals> to explicitly define all the accidentals of a key signature. Thus K:D Phr ^f could also be notated as K:D exp _b _e ^f, where 'exp' is an abbreviation of 'explicit'. Again, the case of the letter is used to determine on which line the accidental is placed.
  # Software that does not support explicit key signatures should mark the individual notes in the tune with the accidentals that apply to them.
  # Scottish highland pipes typically have the scale G A B ^c d e ^f g a and highland pipe music primarily uses the modes D major and A mixolyian (plus B minor and E dorian). Therefore there are two additional keys specifically for notating highland bagpipe tunes; K:HP doesn't put a key signature on the music, as is common with many tune books of this music, while K:Hp marks the stave with F sharp, C sharp and G natural. Both force all the beams and stems of normal notes to go downwards, and of grace notes to go upwards.
  # By default, the abc tune will be typeset with a treble clef. You can add special clef specifiers to the K: field, with or without a key signature, to change the clef and various other staff properties, such as transposition. K: clef=bass, for example, would indicate the bass clef. See clefs and transposition for full details.
  # Note that the first occurrence of the K: field, which must appear in every tune, finishes the tune header. All following lines are considered to be part of the tune body.

  # 3.1.15 R: - rhythm
  # Contains an indication of the type of tune (e.g. hornpipe, double jig, single jig, 48-bar polka, etc). This gives the musician some indication of how a tune should be interpreted as well as being useful for database applications (see background information). It has also been used experimentally by playback software (in particular, abcmus) to provide more realistic playback by altering the stress on particular notes within a bar.
  # See typesetting information fields for details of how the rhythm may be included in the printed score.

  # 3.1.16 B:, D:, F:, S: - background information
  # The information fields B:book (i.e. printed tune book), D:discography (i.e. a CD or LP where the tune can be heard), F:file url (i.e. where the either the abc tune or the abc file can be found on the web) and S:source (i.e. the circumstances under which a tune was collected or learned), as well as the fields H:history, N:notes, O:origin and R:rhythm mentioned above, are used for providing structured background information about a tune. These are particularly aimed at large tune collections (common in abc since its inception) and, if used in a systematic way, mean that abc database software can sort, search and filter on specific fields (for example, to sort by rhythm or filter out all the tunes on a particular CD).
  # The abc standard does not prescribe how these fields should be used, but it is typical to employ several fields of the same type each containing one piece of information, rather than one field containing several pieces of information (see English.abc for some examples).
  # See typesetting information fields for details of how background information may be included in the printed score.

  # ^^ covered under string fields


  # 3.1.17 I: - instruction
  # The I:(instruction) field is used for an extended set of instruction directives concerned with how the abc code is to be interpreted.
  # The I: field can be used interchangeably with stylesheet directives so that any I:directive may instead be written %%directive, and vice-versa. However, to use the inline version, the I: version must be used.
  # Despite this interchangeability, certain directives have been adopted as part of the standard (indicated by I: in this document) and must be implemented by software confirming to this version of the standard; conversely, the stylesheet directives (indicated by %% in this document) are optional.
  # Comment: Since stylesheet directives are optional, and not necessarily portable from one program to another, this means that I: fields containing stylesheet directives should be treated liberally by abc software and, in particular, that I: fields which are not recognised should be ignored.
  # The following table contains a list of the I: field directives adopted as part of the abc standard, with links to further information:

  # directive	     section
  # I:abc-charset    charset field
  # I:abc-version    version field
  # I:abc-include    include field
  # I:abc-creator    creator field
  # I:linebreak      typesetting line breaks
  # I:decoration     decoration dialects

  # Typically, instruction fields are for use in the file header, to set defaults for the file, or (in most cases) in the tune header, but not in the tune body. The occurrence of an instruction field in a tune header overrides that in the file header.
  # Comment: Remember that abc software which extracts separate tunes from a file must insert the fields of the original file header into the header of the extracted tune: this is also true for the fields defined in this section.

  # 3.3 Field continuation
  # A field that is too long for one line may be continued by prefixing +: at the start of the following line. For string-type information fields (see the information fields table for a list of string-type fields), the continuation is considered to add a space between the two half lines.
  # Example: The following two excerpts are considered equivalent.
  # w:Sa-ys my au-l' wan to your aul' wan,
  # +:will~ye come to the Wa-x-ies dar-gle?
  # w:Sa-ys my au-l' wan to your aul' wan, will~ye come to the Wa-x-ies dar-gle?
  # Comment: This is most useful for continuing long w:(aligned lyrics) and H:(history) fields. However, it can also be useful for preventing automatic wrapping by email software (see continuation of input lines).
  # Recommendation for GUI developers: Sometimes users may wish to paste paragraphs of text into an abc file, particularly in the H:(history) field. GUI developers are recommended to provide tools for reformatting such paragraphs, for example by splitting them into several lines each prefixed by +:.
  # There is no limit to the number of times a field may be continued and comments and stylesheet directives may be interspersed between the continuations.
  # Example: The following is a legal continuation of the w: field, although the usage not recommended (the change of font could also be achieved by font specifiers - see font directives).
  # %%vocalfont Times-Roman 14

   # 4.3 Note lengths
   # Throughout this document note lengths are referred as sixteenth, eighth, etc. The equivalents common in the U.K. are sixteenth note = semi-quaver, eighth = quaver, quarter = crotchet and half = minim.
   # The unit note length for the transcription is set in the L: field or, if the L: field does not exist, inferred from the M: field. For example, L:1/8 sets an eighth note as the unit note length.
   # A single letter in the range A-G, a-g then represents a note of this length. For example, if the unit note length is an eighth note, DEF represents 3 eighth notes.
   # Notes of differing lengths can be obtained by simply putting a multiplier after the letter. Thus if the unit note length is 1/16, A or A1 is a sixteenth note, A2 an eighth note, A3 a dotted eighth note, A4 a quarter note, A6 a dotted quarter note, A7 a double dotted quarter note, A8 a half note, A12 a dotted half note, A14 a double dotted half note, A15 a triple dotted half note and so on. If the unit note length is 1/8, A is an eighth note, A2 a quarter note, A3 a dotted quarter note, A4 a half note, and so on.
   # To get shorter notes, either divide them - e.g. if A is an eighth note, A/2 is a sixteenth note, A3/2 is a dotted eighth note, A/4 is a thirty-second note - or change the unit note length with the L: field. Alternatively, if the music has a broken rhythm, e.g. dotted eighth note/sixteenth note pairs, use broken rhythm markers.
   # Note that A/ is shorthand for A/2 and similarly A// = A/4, etc.
   # Comment: Note lengths that can't be translated to conventional staff notation are legal, but their representation by abc typesetting software is undefined and they should be avoided.
   # Note for developers: All compliant software should be able to handle note lengths down to a 128th note; shorter lengths are optional.

   # 4.4 Broken rhythm
   # A common occurrence in traditional music is the use of a dotted or broken rhythm. For example, hornpipes, strathspeys and certain morris jigs all have dotted eighth notes followed by sixteenth notes, as well as vice-versa in the case of strathspeys. To support this, abc notation uses a > to mean 'the previous note is dotted, the next note halved' and < to mean 'the previous note is halved, the next dotted'.
   # Example: The following lines all mean the same thing (the third version is recommended):
   # L:1/16
   # a3b cd3 a2b2c2d2
   # L:1/8
   # a3/2b/2 c/2d3/2 abcd
   # L:1/8
   # a>b c<d abcd
   # As a logical extension, >> means that the first note is double dotted and the second quartered and >>> means that the first note is triple dotted and the length of the second divided by eight. Similarly for << and <<<.
   # Note that the use of broken rhythm markers between notes of unequal lengths will produce undefined results, and should be avoided.

  # 4.5 Rests
  # Rests can be transcribed with a z or an x and can be modified in length in exactly the same way as normal notes. z rests are printed in the resulting sheet music, while x rests are invisible, that is, not shown in the printed music.
  # Multi-measure rests are notated using Z (upper case) followed by the number of measures.
  # Example: The following excerpts, shown with the typeset results, are musically equivalent (although they are typeset differently).
  # Z4|CD EF|GA Bc
  # z4|z4|z4|z4|CD EF|GA Bc
  # When the number of measures is not given, Z is equivalent to a pause of one measure.
  # By extension multi-measure invisible rests are notated using X (upper case) followed by the number of measures and when the number of measures is not given, X is equivalent to a pause of one measure.
  # Comment: Although not particularly valuable, a multi-measure invisible rest could be useful when a voice is silent for several measures.

  # 4.6 Clefs and transposition
  # VOLATILE: This section is subject to some clarifications with regard to transposition, rules for the middle parameter and interactions between different parameters.
  # Clef and transposition information may be provided in the K: key and V: voice fields. The general syntax is:
  # [clef=]<clef name>[<line number>][+8 | -8] [middle=<pitch>] [transpose=<semitones>] [octave=<number>] [stafflines=<lines>]
  # (where <…> denotes a value, […] denotes an optional parameter, and | separates alternative values).
  # <clef name> - may be treble, alto, tenor, bass, perc or none. perc selects the drum clef. clef= may be omitted.
  # [<line number>] - indicates on which staff line the base clef is written. Defaults are: treble: 2; alto: 3; tenor: 4; bass: 4.
  # [+8 | -8] - draws '8' above or below the staff. The player will transpose the notes one octave higher or lower.
  # [middle=<pitch>] - is an alternate way to define the line number of the clef. The pitch indicates what note is displayed on the 3rd line of the staff. Defaults are: treble: B; alto: C; tenor: A,; bass: D,; none: B.
  # [transpose=<semitones>] - for playback, transpose the current voice by the indicated amount of semitones; positive numbers transpose up, negative down. This setting does not affect the printed score. The default is 0.
  # [octave=<number>] to raise (positive number) or lower (negative number) the music code in the current voice by one or more octaves. This usage can help to avoid the need to write lots of apostrophes or commas to raise or lower notes.
  # [stafflines=<lines>] - the number of lines in the staff. The default is 5.
  # Note that the clef, middle, transpose, octave and stafflines specifiers may be used independent of each other.
  # Examples:
  #   K:   clef=alto
  #   K:   perc stafflines=1
  #   K:Am transpose=-2
  #   V:B  middle=d bass
  # Note that although this standard supports the drum clef, there is currently no support for special percussion notes.
  # The middle specifier can be handy when working in the bass clef. Setting K:bass middle=d will save you from adding comma specifiers to the notes. The specifier may be abbreviated to m=.
  # The transpose specifier is useful, for example, for a Bb clarinet, for which the music is written in the key of C although the instrument plays it in the key of Bb:
  #   V:Clarinet
  #   K:C transpose=-2
  # The transpose specifier may be abbreviated to t=.
  # To notate the various standard clefs, one can use the following specifiers:
  # The seven clefs

  # Name          specifier
  # Treble        K:treble
  # Bass          K:bass
  # Baritone      K:bass3
  # Tenor         K:tenor
  # Alto          K:alto
  # Mezzosoprano  K:alto2
  # Soprano       K:alto1

  # More clef names may be allowed in the future, therefore unknown names should be ignored. If the clef is unknown or not specified, the default is treble.
  # Applications may introduce their own clef line specifiers. These specifiers should start with the name of the application, followed a colon, followed by the name of the specifier.
  # Example:
  # V:p1 perc stafflines=3 m=C  mozart:noteC=snare-drum

  # |]  thin-thick double bar line
  # ||  thin-thin double bar line
  # [|  thick-thin double bar line
  # |:  start of repeated section
  # :|  end of repeated section
  # ::  start & end of two repeated sections
  # Recommendation for developers: If an 'end of repeated section' is found without a previous 'start of repeated section', playback programs should restart the music from the beginning of the tune, or from the latest double bar line or end of repeated section.
  # Note that the notation :: is short for :| followed by |:. The variants ::, :|: and :||: are all equivalent.
  # By extension, |:: and ::| mean the start and end of a section that is to be repeated three times, and so on.
  # A dotted bar line can be notated by preceding it with a dot, e.g. .| - this may be useful for notating editorial bar lines in music with very long measures.
  # An invisible bar line may be notated by putting the bar line in brackets, e.g. [|] - this may be useful for notating voice overlay in meter-free music.
  # Abc parsers should be quite liberal in recognizing bar lines. In the wild, bar lines may have any shape, using a sequence of | (thin bar line), [ or ] (thick bar line), and : (dots), e.g. |[| or [|::: .

  # 4.9 First and second repeats
  # First and second repeats can be notated with the symbols [1 and [2, e.g.
  #   faf gfe|[1 dfe dBA:|[2 d2e dcB|].
  # When adjacent to bar lines, these can be shortened to |1 and :|2, but with regard to spaces
  #   | [1
  # is legal, while
  #   | 1
  # is not.
  # Thus, a tune with different ending for the first and second repeats has the general form:
  #   |:  <common body of tune>  |1  <first ending>  :|2  <second ending>  |]
  # Note that in many abc files the |: may not be present.
  
  # 4.10 Variant endings
  # In combination with P: part notation, it is possible to notate more than two variant endings for a section that is to be repeated a number of times.
  # For example, if the header of the tune contains P:A4.B4 then parts A and B will each be played 4 times. To play a different ending each time, you could write in the tune:
  #   P:A
  #   <notes> | [1  <notes>  :| [2 <notes> :| [3 <notes> :| [4 <notes> |]
  # The Nth ending starts with [N and ends with one of ||, :| |] or [|. You can also mark a section as being used for more than one ending e.g.
  #   [1,3 <notes> :|
  # plays on the 1st and 3rd endings and
  #   [1-3 <notes> :|
  # plays on endings 1, 2 and 3. In general, '[' can be followed by any list of numbers and ranges as long as it contains no spaces e.g.
  #   [1,3,5-7  <notes>  :| [2,4,8 <notes> :|

      end
    }
  end
  

  # 4.11 Ties and slurs
  # You can tie two notes of the same pitch together, within or between bars, with a - symbol, e.g. abc-|cba or c4-c4. The tie symbol must always be adjacent to the first note of the pair, but does not need to be adjacent to the second, e.g. c4 -c4 and abc|-cba are not legal - see order of abc constructs.
  # More general slurs can be put in with () symbols. Thus (DEFG) puts a slur over the four notes. Spaces within a slur are OK, e.g. ( D E F G ) .
  # Slurs may be nested:
  # (c (d e f) g a)
  # and they may also start and end on the same note:
  # (c d (e) f g a)
  # A dotted slur may be notated by preceding the opening brace with a dot, e.g. .(cde); it is optional to place a dot immediately before the closing brace. Likewise, a dotted tie can be transcribed by preceding it with a dot, e.g. C.-C. This is especially useful in parts with multiple verses: some verses may require a slur, some may not.
  # It should be noted that although the tie - and slur () produce similar symbols in staff notation they have completely different meanings to player programs and should not be interchanged. Ties connect two successive notes of the same pitch, causing them to be played as a single note, while slurs connect the first and last note of any series of notes, and may be used to indicate phrasing, or that the group should be played legato. Both ties and slurs may be used into, out of and between chords, and in this case the distinction between them is particularly important.

  # 4.12 Grace notes
  # Grace notes can be written by enclosing them in curly braces, {}. For example, a taorluath on the Highland pipes would be written {GdGe}. The tune 'Athol Brose' (in the file Strspys.abc) has an example of complex Highland pipe gracing in all its glory. Although nominally grace notes have no melodic time value, expressions such as {a3/2b/} or {a>b} can be useful and are legal although some software may ignore them. The unit duration to use for gracenotes is not specified by the abc file, but by the software, and might be a specific amount of time (for playback purposes) or a note length (e.g. 1/32 for Highland pipe music, which would allow {ge4d} to code a piobaireachd 'cadence').
  # To distinguish between appoggiaturas and acciaccaturas, the latter are notated with a forward slash immediately following the open brace, e.g. {/g}C or {/gagab}C:
  # The presence of gracenotes is transparent to the broken rhythm construct. Thus the forms A<{g}A and A{g}<A are legal and equivalent to A/2{g}A3/2.

  # 4.13 Duplets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.
  # These can be simply coded with the notation (2ab for a duplet, (3abc for a triplet or (4abcd for a quadruplet, etc, up to (9. The musical meanings are:
  # Symbol	Meaning
  # (2	 2 notes in the time of 3
  # (3	 3 notes in the time of 2
  # (4	 4 notes in the time of 3
  # (5	 5 notes in the time of n
  # (6	 6 notes in the time of 2
  # (7	 7 notes in the time of n
  # (8	 8 notes in the time of 3
  # (9	 9 notes in the time of n
  # If the time signature is compound (6/8, 9/8, 12/8) then n is three, otherwise n is two.
  # More general tuplets can be specified using the syntax (p:q:r which means 'put p notes into the time of q for the next r notes'. If q is not given, it defaults as above. If r is not given, it defaults to p.
  # For example, (3 is equivalent to (3:: or (3:2 , which in turn are equivalent to (3:2:3, whereas (3::2 is equivalent to (3:2:2.
  # This can be useful to include notes of different lengths within a tuplet, for example (3:2:2 G4c2 or (3:2:4 G2A2Bc. It also describes more precisely how the simple syntax works in cases like (3 D2E2F2 or even (3 D3EF2. The number written over the tuplet is p.
  # Spaces that appear between the tuplet specifier and the following notes are to be ignored.

  # 4.14 Decorations

  # L       accent or emphasis
  # M       lowermordent

  # S       segno
  # T       trill
  # u       up-bow
  # v       down-bow
  # Decorations should be placed before the note which they decorate - see order of abc constructs
  # Examples:
  # (3.a.b.c    % staccato triplet
  # vAuBvA      % bowing marks (for fiddlers)
  # Most of the characters above (~HLMOPSTuv) are just short-cuts for commonly used decorations and can even be redefined (see redefinable symbols).
  # More generally, symbols can be entered using the syntax !symbol!, e.g. !trill!A4 for a trill symbol. (Note that the abc standard version 2.0 used instead the syntax +symbol+ - this dialect of abc is still available, but is now deprecated - see decoration dialects.)

  # !mediumphrase!         same, but extending down to the centre line
  # !longphrase!           same, but extending 3/4 of the way down
  # Note that the decorations may be applied to notes, rests, note groups, and bar lines. If a decoration is to be typeset between notes, it may be attached to the y spacer - see typesetting extra space.
  # Spaces may be used freely between each of the symbols and the object to which it should be attached. Also an object may be preceded by multiple symbols, which should be printed one over another, each on a different line.
  # Example:
  # [!1!C!3!E!5!G]  !coda! y  !p! !trill! C   !fermata!|
  # Player programs may choose to ignore most of the symbols mentioned above, though they may be expected to implement the dynamics marks, the accent mark and the staccato dot. Default volume is equivalent to !mf!. On a scale from 0-127, the relative volumes can be roughly defined as: !pppp! = !ppp! = 30, !pp! = 45, !p! = 60, !mp! = 75, !mf! = 90, !f! = 105, !ff! = 120, !fff! = !ffff! = 127.
  # Abc software may also allow users to define new symbols in a package dependent way.
  # Note that symbol names may not contain any spaces, [, ], | or : signs, e.g. while !dacapo! is legal, !da capo! is not.
  # If an unimplemented or unknown symbol is found, it should be ignored.
  # Recommendation: A good source of general information about decorations can be found at http://www.dolmetsch.com/musicalsymbols.htm.

  # 4.15 Symbol lines
  # Adding many symbols to a line of music can make a tune difficult to read. In such cases, a symbol line (a line that contains only !…! decorations, "…" chord symbols or annotations) can be used, analogous to a line of lyrics.
  # A symbol line starts with s:, followed by a line of symbols. Matching of notes and symbols follow the alignment rules defined for lyrics (meaning that symbols in an s: line cannot be aligned on grace notes, rests or spacers).
  # Example:
  #    CDEF    | G```AB`c
  # s: "^slow" | !f! ** !fff!
  # It is also possible to stack s: lines to produced multiple symbols on a note.
  # Example: The following two excerpts are equivalent and would place a decorations plus a chord on the E.
  #    C2  C2 Ez   A2|
  # s: "C" *  "Am" * |
  # s: *   *  !>!  * |
  # "C" C2 C2 "Am" !>! Ez A2|

  # 4.16 Redefinable symbols
  # As a short cut to writing symbols which avoids the !symbol! syntax (see decorations), the letters H-W and h-w and the symbol ~ can be assigned with the U: field. For example, to assign the letter T to represent the trill, you can write:
  # U: T = !trill!
  # You can also use "^text", etc (see annotations below) in definitions
  # Example: To print a plus sign over notes, define p as follows and use it before the required notes:
  # U: p = "^+"
  # Symbol definitions can be written in the file header, in which case they apply to all the tunes in that file, or in a tune header, when they apply only to that tune, and override any previous definitions. Programs may also make use of a set of global default definitions, which apply everywhere unless overridden by local definitions. You can assign the same symbol to two or more letters e.g.
  # U: T = !trill!
  # U: U = !trill!
  # in which case the same visible symbol will be produced by both letters (but they may be played differently), and you can de-assign a symbol by writing:
  # U: T = !nil!
  # or
  # U: T = !none!
  # The standard set of definitions (if you do not redefine them) is:
  # U: ~ = !roll!
  # U: H = !fermata!
  # U: L = !accent!
  # U: M = !lowermordent!
  # U: O = !coda!
  # U: P = !uppermordent!
  # U: S = !segno!
  # U: T = !trill!
  # U: u = !upbow!
  # U: v = !downbow!

  # 4.17 Chords and unisons
  # Chords (i.e. more than one note head on a single stem) can be coded with [] symbols around the notes, e.g.
  # [CEGc]
  # indicates the chord of C major. They can be grouped in beams, e.g.
  # [d2f2][ce][df]
  # but there should be no spaces within the notation for a chord. See the tune 'Kitchen Girl' in the sample file Reels.abc for a simple example.
  # All the notes within a chord should normally have the same length, but if not, the chord duration is that of the first note.
  # Recommendation: Although playback programs should not have any difficulty with notes of different lengths, typesetting programs may not always be able to render the resulting chord to staff notation (for example, an eighth and a quarter note cannot be represented on the same stem) and the result is undefined. Consequently, this is not recommended.
  # More complicated chords can be transcribed with the & operator (see voice overlay).
 # The chord forms a syntactic grouping, to which the same prefixes and postfixes can be attached as to an ordinary note (except for accidentals which should be attached to individual notes within the chord and decorations which may be attached to individual notes within the chord or may be attached to the chord as a whole).
  # Example:
  # ( "^I" !f! [CEG]- > [CEG] "^IV" [F=AC]3/2"^V"[GBD]/  H[CEG]2 )
  # When both inside and outside the chord length modifiers are used, they should be multiplied. Example: [C2E2G2]3 has the same meaning as [CEG]6.
  # If the chord contains two notes of the same pitch, then it is a unison (e.g. a note played on two strings of a violin simultaneously) and is shown with one stem and two note-heads.
  # Example:
  # [DD]

  # 4.18 Chord symbols
  # VOLATILE: The list of chords and how they are handled will be extended at some point. Until then programs should treat chord symbols quite liberally.
  # Chord symbols (e.g. chords/bass notes) can be put in under the melody line (or above, depending on the package) using double-quotation marks placed to the left of the note it is sounded with, e.g. "Am7"A2D2.
  # The chord has the format <note><accidental><type></bass>, where <note> can be A-G, the optional <accidental> can be b, #, the optional <type> is one or more of
  # m or min        minor
  # maj             major
  # dim             diminished
  # aug or +        augmented
  # sus             suspended
  # 7, 9 ...        7th, 9th, etc.
  # and </bass> is an optional bass note.
  # A slash after the chord type is used only if the optional bass note is also used, e.g., "C/E". If the bass note is a regular part of the chord, it indicates the inversion, i.e., which note of the chord is lowest in pitch. If the bass note is not a regular part of the chord, it indicates an additional note that should be sounded with the chord, below it in pitch. The bass note can be any letter (A-G or a-g), with or without a trailing accidental sign (b or #). The case of the letter used for the bass note does not affect the pitch.
  # Alternate chords can be indicated for printing purposes (but not for playback) by enclosing them in parentheses inside the double-quotation marks after the regular chord, e.g., "G(Em)".
  # Note to developers: Software should also be able to recognise and handle appropriately the unicode versions of flat, natural and sharp symbols (♭, ♮, ♯) - see special symbols.

  end


  # 4.19 Annotations
  # General text annotations can be added above, below or on the staff in a similar way to chord symbols. In this case, the string within double quotes is preceded by one of five symbols ^, _, <, > or @ which controls where the annotation is to be placed; above, below, to the left or right respectively of the following note, rest or bar line. Using the @ symbol leaves the exact placing of the string to the discretion of the interpreting program. These placement specifiers distinguish annotations from chord symbols, and should prevent programs from attempting to play or transpose them. All text that follows the placement specifier is treated as a text string.
  # Where two or more annotations with the same placement specifier are placed consecutively, e.g. for fingerings, the notation program should draw them on separate lines, with the first listed at the top.
  # Example: The following annotations place the note between parentheses.
  # "<(" ">)" C

  # 5. Lyrics
  # The W: information field (uppercase W) can be used for lyrics to be printed separately below the tune.
  # The w: information field (lowercase w) in the tune body, supplies lyrics to be aligned syllable by syllable with previous notes of the current voice.

  # ^^ covered under string fields

  # 5.1 Alignment
  # When adjacent, w: fields indicate different verses (see below), but for non-adjacent w: fields, the alignment of the lyrics:
  # starts at the first note of the voice if there is no previous w: field; or
  # starts at the first note after the notes aligned to the previous w: field; and
  # associates syllables to notes up to the end of the w: line.
  # Example: The following two examples are equivalent.
  # C D E F|
  # w: doh re mi fa
  # G A B c|
  # w: sol la ti doh
  # C D E F|
  # G A B c|
  # w: doh re mi fa sol la ti doh
  # Comment: The second example, made possible by an extension (introduced in abc 2.1) of the alignment rules, means that lyrics no longer have to follow immediately after the line of notes to which they are attached. Indeed, the placement of the lyrics can be postponed to the end of the tune body. However, the extension of the alignment rules is not fully backwards compatible with abc 2.0 - see outdated lyrics alignment for an explanation.
  # If there are fewer syllables than available notes, the remaining notes have no lyric (blank syllables); thus the appearance of a w: field associates all the notes that have appeared previously with a syllable (either real or blank).
  # Example: In the following example the empty w: field means that the 4 G notes have no lyric associated with them.
  # C D E F|
  # w: doh re mi fa
  # G G G G|
  # w:
  # F E F C|
  # w: fa mi re doh
  # If there are more syllables than available notes, any excess syllables will be ignored.
  # Recommendation for developers: If a w: line does not contain the correct number of syllables for the corresponding notes, the program should warn the user. However, having insufficient syllables is legitimate usage (as above) and so the program may allow these warnings to be switched off.
  # Note that syllables are not aligned on grace notes, rests or spacers and that tied, slurred or beamed notes are treated as separate notes in this context.
  # The lyrics lines are treated as text strings. Within the lyrics, the words should be separated by one or more spaces and to correctly align them the following symbols may be used:
  # Symbol	Meaning
  # -	 (hyphen) break between syllables within a word
  # _	 (underscore) previous syllable is to be held for an extra note
  # *	 one note is skipped (i.e. * is equivalent to a blank syllable)
  # ~	 appears as a space; aligns multiple words under one note
  # \-	 appears as hyphen; aligns multiple syllables under one note
  # |	 advances to the next bar
  # Note that if - is preceded by a space or another hyphen, the - is regarded as a separate syllable.
  # When an underscore is used next to a hyphen, the hyphen must always come first.
  # If there are not as many syllables as notes in a measure, typing a | automatically advances to the next bar; if there are enough syllables the | is just ignored.
  # Examples:
  # w: syll-a-ble    is aligned with three notes
  # w: syll-a--ble   is aligned with four notes
  # w: syll-a -ble   (equivalent to the previous line)
  # w: time__        is aligned with three notes
  # w: of~the~day    is treated as one syllable (i.e. aligned with one note)
  #                  but appears as three separate words
  #  gf|e2dc B2A2|B2G2 E2D2|.G2.G2 GABc|d4 B2
  # w: Sa-ys my au-l' wan to your aul' wan,
  # +: Will~ye come to the Wa-x-ies dar-gle?
  # See field continuation for the meaning of the +: field continuation.

  # 6. Typesetting and playback
  # 6.1 Typesetting
  # 6.1.1 Typesetting line-breaks
  # Terminology: Line-breaks in a document (also known in computing as new lines, line-feeds, carriage-returns, end-of-lines, etc.) determine how the document is set out on the page. Throughout this section, and elsewhere in the standard, a distinction should be noted between
  # a code line-break, meaning a line-break in the abc tune body, and, in particular, at the end of a line of music code;
  # a score line-break, meaning a line-break in the printed score.
  # The fundamental mechanism for typesetting score line-breaks is by using code line-breaks - one line of music code in the tune body normally corresponds to one line of printed music.
  # Of course the printed representation of a line of music code may be too long for the staff, so if necessary, typesetting programs should introduce additional score line-breaks. As a consequence, if you would prefer score line-breaks to be handled completely automatically (as is common in non-abc scoring software), then just type the tune body on a single line of music code.
  # Even though most abc GUI software should wrap over-long lines, typing the tune body on a single line may not always be convenient, particularly for users who wish to include code line-breaks to aid readability or if the abc code is to be emailed (see continuation of input lines).
  # Furthermore, in the past some typesetting programs used ! characters in the abc code to force score line-breaks.
  # As a result, abc 2.1 introduces a new line-breaking instruction.
  # I:linebreak
  # To allow for all line-breaking preferences, the I:linebreak instruction may be used, together with four possible values, to control score line-breaking.
  # "I:linebreak $" indicates that the $ symbol is used in the tune body to typeset a score line-break. Any code line-breaks are ignored for typesetting purposes.
  # Example: The following abc code should be typeset on two lines.

  # I:linebreak $
  # K:G
  # |:abc def|$fed cba:|

  # "I:linebreak !" indicates that the ! symbol is used to typeset a score line-break. Any code line-breaks are ignored for typesetting purposes.
  # Comment: The "I:linebreak !" instruction works in the same way as I:linebreak $ and is primarily provided for backwards compatibility - see line-breaking dialects, so that "I:linebreak $" is the preferred usage. "I:linebreak !" also automatically invokes the "I:decoration +" instruction - see decoration dialects. Finally, "I:linebreak !" is equivalent to the deprecated directive %%continueall true - see outdated directives.
  # "I:linebreak <EOL>" indicates that the End Of Line character (CR, LF or CRLF) is used to typeset a score line-break. In other words, code line-breaks are used for typesetting score line-breaks.
  # "I:linebreak <none>" indicates that all line-breaking is to be carried out automatically and any code line-breaks are ignored for typesetting purposes.
  # The values <EOL>, $ and ! may also be combined so that more that one symbol can indicate a score line-break.
  # The default line-break setting is:
  # I:linebreak <EOL> $
  # meaning that both code line-breaks, and $ symbols, generate a score line-break.
  # Comment: Although "I:linebreak $ !" is legal it is not recommended as it uses two different symbols to mean the same thing.
  # An I:linebreak instruction can be used either in the file header (in which case it is applied to every tune in the abc file), or in a tune header (in which case it is applied to that tune only and overrides a line-breaking instruction in the file header). Similarly, if two I:linebreak instructions appear in a file header or a tune header, the second cancels the first.
  # Comment: It can be sometimes be useful to include two instructions together - for example, "I:linebreak <EOL> $" and "I:linebreak <none>" can be used to toggle between default and automatic line-breaking simply by swapping the position of the two lines.
  # I:linebreak instructions are not allowed in the tune body (principally because it conflicts with the human readability of the music code).

  # Suppressing score line-breaks
  # When the <EOL> character is being used in the tune body to indicate score line-breaks, it sometimes useful to be able to tell typesetting software to ignore a particular code line-breaks. This is achieved using a backslash (\) at the end of a line of music code. The backslash may be followed by trailing whitespace and/or comments, since they are removed before the line is processed.
  # Example: The following two excerpts are considered equivalent and should be typeset as a single staff in the printed score.

  # abc cba|\ % end of line comment
  # abc cba|

  # abc cba|abc cba|

  # The backslash effectively joins two lines together for processing so if space is required between the two half lines (for example, to prevent the notes from being beamed together), it can be placed before the backslash, or at the beginning of the next half line.
  # Example: The following three excerpts are considered equivalent.

  # abc \
  # cba|

  # abc\
  #  cba|

  # abc cba|  

  # There is no limit to the number of lines that may be joined together in this way. However, a backslash must not be used before an empty line.
  # Example: The following is legal.

  # cdef|\
  # \
  # cedf:|
  # Example: The following is not legal.

  # cdef|\
  #
  # cdef:|

  # In the examples above, where a line of music code follows immediately after a line ending in backslash, the backslash acts as a continuation for two lines of music code and can therefore be used to split up long music code lines.
  # More importantly, however, any information fields and stylesheet directives are processed (and comments are removed) at the point where the physical line-break occurs. Hence the backslash is commonly used to include meter or key changes halfway through a line of music.
  # Example: The following should be typeset as a single staff in the printed score.

  # abc cab|\
  # %%setbarnb 10
  # M:9/8
  # %comment
  # abc cba abc|

  # Alternative usage example: The above could also be achieved using inline fields, the I:<directive> form instead of %%<directive> and a r:remark in place of the comment, i.e.

  # abc cab|[I:setbarnb 10][M:9/8][r:comment]abc cba abc|

  # Finally, note that if the the <EOL> character is not being used to indicate score line-breaks, then the backslash is effectively redundant.
  # Recommendation to users: If you find that you are using backslash symbols on most lines of music code, then consider instead using "I:linebreak <none>" or "I:linebreak $" which will mean that all the code line-breaks will be ignored for the purposes of generating score line-breaks (and, in the latter case, you can encode a score line-breaks with the $ character).

  # 7. Multiple voices
  # VOLATILE: Multi-voice music is under active review, with discussion about control voices and interaction between P:, V: and T: fields. It is intended that the syntax will be finalised in abc 2.2.
  # The V: field allows the writing of multi-voice music. In multi-voice abc tunes, the tune body is divided into several voices, each beginning with a V: field. All the notes following such a V: field, up to the next V: field or the end of the tune body, belong to the voice.
  # The basic syntax of the field is:
  # V:ID
  # where ID can be either a number or a string, that uniquely identifies the voice in question. When using a string, only the first 20 characters of it will be distinguished. The ID will not be printed on the staff; it's only function is to indicate, throughout the abc tune, which music line belongs to which voice.
  # Example:
  # X:1
  # T:Zocharti Loch
  # C:Louis Lewandowski (1821-1894)

  # This layout closely resembles printed music, and permits the corresponding notes on different voices to be vertically aligned so that the chords can be read directly from the abc. The addition of single remark lines "%" between the grouped staves, indicating the bar numbers, also makes the source more legible.
  # V: can appear both in the body and the header. In the latter case, V: is used exclusively to set voice properties. For example, the name property in the example above, specifies which label should be printed on the first staff of the voice in question. Note that these properties may be also set or changed in the tune body. The V: properties are fully explained below.
  # Please note that the exact grouping of voices on the staff or staves is not specified by V: itself. This may be specified with the %%score stylesheet directive. See voice grouping for details.

  # indicates that voice T will be drawn on a staff labelled Tenor, using the treble clef with a small 8 underneath. Player programs will transpose the notes by one octave. Possible voice definitions include:
  # name="voice name" - the voice name is printed on the left of the first staff only. The characters \n produce a newline in the output.
  # subname="voice subname" - the voice subname is printed on the left of all staves but the first one.
  # stem=up/down - forces the note stem direction.
  # clef= - specifies a clef; see clefs and transposition for details.
  # The name specifier may be abbreviated to nm=. The subname specifier may be abbreviated to snm=.
  # Applications may implement their own specifiers, but must gracefully ignore specifiers they don't understand or implement. This is required for portability of abc files between applications.

  # [V:2] E4|[M:3/4]G3 |E3 |

  # VOLATILE: See above.
  # The & operator may be used to temporarily overlay several voices within one measure. Each & operator sets the time point of the music back by one bar line, and the notes which follow it form a temporary voice in parallel with the preceding one. This may only be used to add one complete bar's worth of music for each &.
  # Example:
  # A2 | c d e f g  a  &\
  #      A A A A A  A  &\
  #      F E D C B, A, |]
  # Words in w: lines (and symbols in s: lines) are matched to the corresponding notes as per the normal rules for lyric alignment (see lyrics), disregarding any overlay in the accompanying music code.
  # Example:
  #     g4 f4 | e6 e2 |
  # && (d8    | c6) c2|
  # w: ha-la-| lu-yoh
  # +: lu-   |   -yoh
  # This revokes the abc 2.0 usage of & in w: and s: lines, which is now deprecated (see disallowed).

  # 8. Abc data format
  # Each line in the file may end with white-space which will be ignored. For the purpose of this standard, ASCII tab and space characters are equivalent and are both included in the term 'white-space'. Applications must be able to interpret end-of-line markers in Unix (<LF>), Windows/DOS (<CR><LF>), and Macintosh style (<CR>) correctly.

  # 8.1 Tune body
  # Within the tune body, all the printable ASCII characters may be used for the music code. These are:
  #  !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@
  # ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`
  # abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~
  # Of these, the following characters are currently reserved:
  # # * ; ? @
  # In future standards they may be used to extend the abc syntax.
  # To ensure forward compatibility, current software should ignore these characters when they appear inside or between note groups, possibly giving a warning. However, these characters may not be ignored when they appear inside text strings or information fields.
  # Example:
  # @a !pp! #bc2/3* [K:C#] de?f "@this $2was difficult to parse?" y |**
  # should be treated as:
  # a !pp! bc2/3 [K:C#] def "@this $2was difficult to parse?" y |

  end


  # 8.2 Text strings
  # Text written within an abc file, either as part of an information field, an annotation or as free text / typeset text, is known as a text string, or more fully, an abc text string. (Note that the abc standard version 2.0 referred to a text string as an abc string.)
  # Typically when there are several lines of text, each line forms a separate text string, although the distinction is not essential.
  # The contents of a text string may be written using any legal character set. The default character set is utf-8, giving access to every Unicode character.
  # However, not all text editors support utf-8 and so to avoid portability problems when writing accented characters in text strings, it also possible to use three other encoding options:
  # mnemonics - for example, é can be represented by \'e. These mnemonics are are based on TeX encodings and are always in the format backslash-mnemonic-letter. They have been available since the earliest days of abc and are widely used in legacy abc files. They are generally easy to remember and easy to read, but are not comprehensive in terms of the possible accents they can represent.
  # named html entities - for example, é can be represented by &eacute;. These encodings are not common in legacy abc files but are convenient for websites which use abc and generally easy to remember. However they are not particularly easy to read and are not fully comprehensive in terms of the possible accents they can represent.
  # fixed width unicode - for example, é can be represented by \u00e9 using the 16-bit unicode representation 00e9 (or \U000000e9 using 32-bit). These encodings are not common in legacy abc files and are not easy to read but give comprehensive access to all unicode characters.
  # All conforming abc typesetting software should support (understand and be able to convert) the subset of accents and ligatures given in the appendix, supported accents & ligatures, together with the special characters and symbols listed below.
  # A summary, with examples, is as follows:

  # Accent	 Examples	 Encodings
  # grave	À à è ò	\`A \`a \`e \`o
  # acute	Á á é ó	\'A \'a \'e \'o
  # circumflex	Â â ê ô	\^A \^a \^e \^o
  # tilde	Ã ã ñ õ	\~A \~a \~n \~o
  # umlaut	Ä ä ë ö	\"A \"a \"e \"o
  # cedilla	Ç ç	\cC \cc
  # ring	Å å	\AA \aa
  # slash	Ø ø	\/O \/o
  # breve	Ă ă Ĕ ĕ	\uA \ua \uE \ue
  # caron	Š š Ž ž	\vS \vs \vZ \vz
  # double acute	Ő ő Ű ű	\HO \Ho \HU \Hu
  # ligatures	ß Æ æ œ	\ss \AE \ae \oe

  # Programs that have difficulty typesetting accented letters may reduce them to the base letter or, in the case of ligatures, the two base letters ignoring the backslash.
  # Examples: When reduced to the base letter, \oA becomes A, \"o becomes o, \ss becomes ss, \AE becomes AE, etc.
  # For fixed width unicode, \u or \U must be followed by 4 or 8 hexadecimal characters respectively. Thus if any of the 4 characters after \u is not hexadecimal, then it is interpreted as a breve.
  # Special characters
  # Characters that are meaningful in the context of a text string can be escaped using a backslash as follows:
  # type \\ to get a backslash;
  # type \% to get a percent symbol that is not interpreted as the start of a comment;
  # type \& to get an ampersand that is not interpreted as the start of a named html entity (although an ampersand followed by white-space is interpreted as is - for example, gin & tonic is OK, but G\&T requires the backslash);
  # type &quot; or \u0022 to get double quote marks in an annotation
  # Special symbols
  # The following symbols are also useful:
  # type &copy; or \u00a9 for the copyright symbol ©
  # type \u266d for a flat symbol ♭
  # type \u266e for a natural symbol ♮
  # type \u266f for a sharp symbol ♯
  # VOLATILE: Finally note that currently the specifiers $1, $2, $3 and $4 can be used to change the font within a text string. However, this feature is likely to change in future versions of the standard - see font directives for more details.

  # ^^ accomplished in post-processing (see TextString class)


  # 9. Macros
  # This standard defines an optional system of macros which is principally used to define the way in which ornament symbols such as the tilde ~ are played (although it could be used for many other purposes).
  # Software implementing these macros, should first expand the macros defined in this section, and only afterwards apply any relevant U: replacement (see Redefinable symbols).
  # When these macros are stored in an abc header file (see include field), they may form a powerful library.
  # There are two kinds of macro, called Static and Transposing.

  # 9.1 Static macros
  # You define a static macro by writing into the tune header something like this:
  #  m: ~G3 = G{A}G{F}G
  # When you play the tune, the program searches the tune header for macro definitions, then does a search and replace on its internal copy of the text before passing that to the parser which plays the tune. Every occurence of ~G3 in the tune is replaced by G{A}G{F}G, and that is what gets played. Only ~G3 notes are affected, ~G2, ~g3, ~F3 etc. are ignored.
  # You can put in as many macros as you want, and indeed, if you only use static macros you will need to write a separate macro for each combination of pitch and note-length. Here is an example:
  # X:50
  # T:Apples in Winter
  # S:Trad, arr. Paddy O'Brien
  # R:jig
  # m: ~g2 = {a}g{f}g
  # m: ~D2 = {E}D{C}D
  # M:6/8
  # K:D
  # G/2A/2|BEE dEE|BAG FGE|~D2D FDF|ABc ded|
  # BEE BAB|def ~g2 e|fdB AGF|GEE E2:|
  # d|efe edB|ege fdB|dec dAF|DFA def|
  # [1efe edB|def ~g2a|bgb afa|gee e2:|
  # [2edB def|gba ~g2e|fdB AGF|GEE E2||
  # Here I have put in two static macros, since there are two different notes in the tune marked with a tilde.
  # A static macro definition consists of four parts:
  # the field identifier m:
  # the target string - e.g ~G3
  # the equals sign
  # the replacement string - e.g. G{A}G{F}G
  # The target string can consist of any string up to 31 characters in length, except that it may not include the letter 'n', for reasons which will become obvious later. You don't have to use the tilde, but of course if you don't use a legal combination of abc, other programs will not be able to play your tune.
  # The replacement string consists of any legal abc text up to 200 characters in length. It's up to you to ensure that the target and replacement strings occupy the same time interval (the program does not check this). Both the target and replacement strings may include spaces if necessary, but leading and trailing spaces are stripped off so
  # m:~g2={a}g{f}g
  # is perfectly OK, although less readable.

  # 9.2 Transposing macros
  # If your tune has ornaments on lots of different notes, and you want them to all play with the same ornament pattern, you can use transposing macros to achieve this. Transposing macros are written in exactly the same way as static macros, except that the note symbol in the target string is represented by 'n' (meaning any note) and the note symbols in the replacement string by other letters (h to z) which are interpreted according to their position in the alphabet relative to n.
  # So, for example I could re-write the static macro m: ~G3 = G{A}G{F}G as a transposing macro m: ~n3 = n{o}n{m}n. When the transposing macro is expanded, any note of the form ~n3 will be replaced by the appropriate pattern of notes. Notes of the form ~n2 (or other lengths) will be ignored, so you will have to write separate transposing macros for each note length.
  # Here's an example:
  # X:35
  # T:Down the Broom
  # S:Trad, arr. Paddy O'Brien
  # R:reel
  # M:C|
  # m: ~n2 = (3o/n/m/ n                % One macro does for all four rolls
  # K:ADor
  # EAAG~A2 Bd|eg~g2 egdc|BGGF GAGE|~D2B,D GABG|
  # EAAG ~A2 Bd|eg~g2 egdg|eg~g2 dgba|gedB BAA2:|
  # ~a2ea agea|agbg agef|~g2dg Bgdg|gfga gede|
  # ~a2 ea agea|agbg ageg|dg~g2 dgba|gedB BA A2:|
  # A transposing macro definition consists of four parts:
  # the field identifier m:
  # the target string - e.g ~n3
  # the equals sign
  # the replacement string - e.g. n{o}n{m}n
  # The target string can consist of any string up to 31 characters in length, except that it must conclude with the letter 'n', followed by a number which specifies the note length.
  # The replacement string consists of any legal abc text up to 200 characters in length, where note pitches are defined by the letters h - z, the pitches being interpreted relative to that of the letter n. Once again you should ensure that the time intervals match. You should not use accidentals in transposing macros
  # Comment: It is almost impossible to think of a way to transpose ~=a3 or ~^G2 which will work correctly under all circumstances, so a static macro should be used for cases like these.

  rule macro_field do
    'm:' field_space* macro_target field_space* '=' field_space* macro_replace <MacroFieldNode> {

        { target => replacement }

  # 11. Stylesheet directives and pseudo-comments
  # 11.0 Introduction to directives

  # 11.0.1 Disclaimer
  # In the early days of abc, pseudo-comments (lines starting with %%) were introduced as a means of adding software-specific information and formatting instructions into abc files; because they started with a % symbol software that didn't recognise them would ignore them as a comment.
  # In a valiant effort, abc 2.0 made an attempt to standardise these pseudo-comments with the introduction stylesheet directives and the abc stylesheet specification. This was described as "not part of the ABC specification itself" but as "an additional standard" containing directives to control how the content and structural information described by the abc code "is to be actually rendered, for example by a typesetting or player program".
  # Unfortunately, however, there are a very large number of pseudo-comment directives and not all of them are well-defined. Furthermore, some directives, in particular the text directives and accidental directives, actually contain content and / or structural information (as opposed to rendering instructions).
  # Abc 2.1 has stepped away from this approach somewhat.
  # The pseudo-comments are still very much accepted as a way for developers to introduce experimental features and software-specific formatting instructions. However, when a directive gains acceptance, either by being implemented in more than one piece of software, or by its use in a substantial body of tunes, the aim is that the usage will be standardised and adopted in the standard and the I: instruction form recommended in place of the %% pseudo-comment form.
  # In particular, it is intended that abc 2.3 will address markup and embedding and at that point a number of the text-based directives, together with other widely accepted forms, will be formally incorporated.
  # For the moment, section 11 is retained mostly unchanged from abc 2.0 (save for typo corrections) but, as a result of the foregoing, the whole of section 11 and all stylesheet directives should regarded as VOLATILE.

  # 11.0.2 Stylesheet directives
  # A stylesheet directive is a line that starts with %%, followed by a directive that gives instructions to typesetting or player programs.
  # Examples:
  # %%papersize A4
  # %%newpage
  # %%setbarnb 10
  # Alternatively, any stylesheet directive may be written as an I:instruction field although this is not recommended for usages which have not been standardised (i.e. it is not recommended for any directives described in section 11).
  # Examples: Not recommended.
  # I:papersize A4
  # I:newpage
  # I:setbarnb 10
  # Inline field notation may be used to place a stylesheet directive in the middle of a line of music:
  # Example:
  # CDEFG|[I:setbarnb 10]ABc
  # If a program doesn't recognise a stylesheet directive, it should just ignore it.
  # It should be stressed that the stylesheet directives are not formally part of the abc standard itself. Furthermore, the list of possible directives is long and not standardised. They are provided by a variety of programs for specifying layout, text annotations, fonts, spacings, voice instruments, transposition and other details.
  # Strictly speaking, abc applications don't have to conform to the same set of stylesheet directives. However, it is desirable that they do in order to make abc files portable between different computer systems.
  
  rule pseudo_comment do
    instruction_field
  end


  # 11.1 Voice grouping
  # VOLATILE: This section is under review as part of the general discussion about multiple voices for abc 2.2. See also the section 11 disclaimer.
  # Basic syntax:
  # %%score <voice-id1> <voice-id2> ... <voice-idn>
  # The score directive specifies which voices should be printed in the score and how they should be grouped on the staves.
  # Voices that are enclosed by parentheses () will go on one staff. Together they form a voice group. A voice that is not enclosed by parentheses forms a voice group on its own that will be printed on a separate staff.
  # If voice groups are enclosed by curly braces {}, the corresponding staves will be connected by a big curly brace printed in front of the staves. Together they form a voice block. This format is used especially for typesetting keyboard music.
  # If voice groups or braced voice blocks are enclosed by brackets [], the corresponding staves will be connected by a big bracket printed in front of the staves. Together they form a voice block.
  # If voice blocks or voice groups are separated from each other by a | character, continued bar lines will be drawn between the associated staves.
  # Example:
  # %%score Solo  [(S A) (T B)]  {RH | (LH1 LH2)}
  # If a single voice surrounded by two voice groups is preceded by a star (*), the voice is marked to be floating. This means that the voice won't be printed on it's own staff; rather the software should automatically determine, for each note of the voice, whether it should be printed on the preceding staff or on the following staff.
  # Software that does not support floating voices may simply print the voice on the preceding staff, as if it were part of the preceding voice group.
  # Examples:
  # %%score {RH *M| LH}
  # %%score {(RH1 RH2) *M| (LH1 LH2)}
  # String parts in an orchestral work are usually bracketed together and the top two (1st/2nd violins) then braced outside the bracket:
  # %%score [{Vln1 | Vln2} | Vla | Vc | DB]
  # Any voices appearing in the tune body will only be printed if it is mentioned in the score directive.
  # When the score directive occurs within the tune body, it resets the music generator, so that voices may appear and disappear for some period of time.
  # If no score directive is used, all voices that appear in the tune body are printed on separate staves.
  # See Canzonetta.abc for an extensive example.
  # An alternative directive to %%score is %%staves.
  # Both %%score and %%staves directives accept the same parameters, but measure bar indications work the opposite way. Therefore, %%staves [S|A|T|B] is equivalent to %%score [S A T B] and means that continued bar lines are not drawn between the associated staves, while %%staves [S A T B] is equivalent to %%score [S|A|T|B] and means that they are drawn.
